 * L in SOLID = Liskov Substitution Principle

 * Inheritence = Is-A way of thinking.
 *
 * Liskov Substitution Principle changes the 'Is-A' way of thinking
 *
 * "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction!"
 *
 * Solution 1: (racing car example)
 * Break the hierarchy if it fails the substitution test.
 *
 * Solution 2: (in-house product example)
 * Tell, don't ask. (restructure the code)
