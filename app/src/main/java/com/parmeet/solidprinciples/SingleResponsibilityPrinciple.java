/**
 *
 * S in SOLID = Single Responsibility Principle
 *
 * Every software component should have one and only one responsibility.
 * - component can be a class, a method, or a module.
 *
 * As per uncle Bob:
 * Every software component should have one and only one reason to change
 *
 * Cohesion
 * - Cohesion is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related
 * - degree of relation
 * - Aim for high cohesion
 * - Higher cohesion helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
 * - low cohesion is bad
 *
 * Coupling
 * - Coupling is defined as the level of inter-dependency between various software components
 * - Loose coupling helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
 * - tight coupling - undesirable feature
 * - Aim for loose coupling
 *
 * Aim for high cohesion.
 * Aim for loose coupling.
 * Following Single Responsibility Principle can lead to considerable software maintenance costs.
